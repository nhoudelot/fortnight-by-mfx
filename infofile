mfx goes open-source(*):

'fortnight'

a 'crap in two weeks' intro

requires the following:

a linux
a libmikmod
a libsdl
a libbzip2
a glibc

(aaand somewhat recent versions of each. i have debian unstable, except fixed with 
some cvs-versions of some libs so it's not very outdated stuff i'm linking into... 
and -dev of each if you want to recompile for some reason or another)

code: 216
music: dixan
freecell: uncle-x


greets:

phn, kooma, haujobb, exceed, calodox, retro a.c, damage, farb-rausch, byterapers, 
doomsday, dekadence and all the rest...

(*) so you want to start making quality linux-demos?
everything you need is included in the package. the code is conformant 
to the finest standards and an excellent starting point for newbies to 
learn what it is all about. in no way it is done tired in 4am with quickly
copypasted old crap and halfway optimized actually slowing it down or 
anything like that. enjoy.

yeah, and if you're a god or something this way you can translate it 
to windoze too:) (getting working libs for my old vc5.0 is not a too easy 
task these days.. but maybe you'll have better luck)
