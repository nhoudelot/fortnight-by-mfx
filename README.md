## fortnight, a demonstration released by mfx for The Party 2001

**Code**      : 216 jwuolijo@cs.helsinki.fi  
**Music**     : dixan dixan@spinningkids.org  
**Freecell** : uncle-x naleskin@cs.helsinki.fi  

mfx goes open-source(*):  
'fortnight'
a 'crap in two weeks' intro

### requires the following:

 * a linux
 * a libmikmod
 * a libsdl
 * a libbzip2
 * a glibc

(aaand somewhat recent versions of each. i have debian unstable, except fixed with some cvs-versions of some libs so it's not very outdated stuff i'm linking into... and -dev of each if you want to recompile for some reason or another)


### greets:

phn, kooma, haujobb, exceed, calodox, retro a.c, damage, farb-rausch, byterapers, doomsday, dekadence and all the rest...

(*) so you want to start making quality linux-demos ?
everything you need is included in the package. the code is conformant 
to the finest standards and an excellent starting point for newbies to learn what it is all about. in no way it is done tired in 4am with quickly copypasted old crap and halfway optimized actually slowing it down or  anything like that. enjoy.
